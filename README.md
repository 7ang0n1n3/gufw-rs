# gufw-rs
gufw clone written in RUST for Arch Linux / Hyprland

VID : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fmM8_NRs_c

Created to replace my shitty script to control UFW from the desktop.
Based it off gufw https://github.com/costales/gufw , I really like this little app when I was using Ubuntu.
Now that I have moved to Arch/Hyprland, could not find replace, so created one.

I am FAR from understanding RUST, but so far this works for my needs.
Will enhance overtime as my needs expand. Hope it will help another Arch/Hyprland user.

Peace OUT!
